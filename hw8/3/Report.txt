Problem 5.9

I started with this one first since it would be alone in its own file.
This was not to difficult, I added a simple if statement that checks if the
operation is a label or not, and if it is, gives an error. If not it proceeds
normally. 

problem 5.8

It took me a while to think about how to do this and a friend suggested 
creating a separate list to store label values that can be cross referenced
to check for duplicates, which is what I did. The list is set back to an empty
list at the end of extract-labels so register machines do not conflict with
eachother's labels.


5.19
I tried implementing breakpoints as lists and modifying various procedures 
like execute to implement it but I keep getting errors

I tried to implement proceed easily, it simply calls the execute procedure 
again to continue running without resetting anything.

I wanted to implement a register that holds labels and deal with the breakpoint
by taking the offset from the labels and adding that to the position of the 
label to find where the stop. 

After this, based on gradescope I am able to get correct turns for a few parts 
like test-b 4, and some of the registers but none of my set-breakpoint, cancel
etc seem to be working. I see cancel returned something, but it was the wrong 
value.

I cannot find where in my code everything is breaking.
I managed  to fix a lot of my errors as they came from calling the wrong 
register or small typos and mistakes in calling variables however it did not 
remedy the situation. I rewrote the program 3 times so far and I ran out of
time. 

If this is the final submission I have, I ran out of time due to finals
commitments and was unable to proceed forward.
